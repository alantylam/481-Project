## Highlight Walkthrough
Highlight 1

Our first highlight is to use the application to book the use of a device. To book a device, users need to press the ‘Devices’ button to get into the devices list. This can be done without logging in. Users can then select the device they want to use by pressing the ‘Details’ button next to a certain device. Next, users need to press the ‘Book/View Schedule’ button to get into the Schedule page. In the schedule page, users need to select the date they want to book. A box will then show under the calendar. Then users need to select a start time and type in the box, in hours, how long they want to book the device. We included this functionality based on feedback, as knowing the estimated job time ahead of time is potentially more useful for more users. Last, users need to click the ‘Submit’ button to confirm their booking.

The second highlight is to use the application to login, and lock a device for immediate use. For the first part, users need to press the ‘Login’ button on the main page. Then, the application will go to the login page. Users need to type in their username and password, then press the ‘Login’ button to login, returning them to the main page logged in. Next, the user needs to click the "Devices" button to get to the devices page.  Here the user clicks the "Favorites" icon, since they are a frequent user.  This brings them to the "Favorites" page, which lists their favorite devices.  They then click on the "Details" button on the device they wish to use.  Next users can find the ‘Lock’ button on the "Details" page. After pressing "Lock", it will change to the ‘Unlock’ button and a box will popup asking the user how long they intend to use the device, as well as an optional notes feature. Users can then type in the number of hours they want to use that device for and submit it. Then that device will be locked and its status will change to ‘In use’. In addition, if they click on the ‘Note’ button at the bottom left of the popup box, users can press it to get into a text box to add some notes. The note symbol will show at the top right corner of device details page after a note is added.  Users can view the notes on that device, even if made by another user, by clicking on the note symbol.  When the device is no longer in use, a user can click on the "Complete" button in the "Notes" popup to delete the note. The notes feature was added, thanks to feedback, to add communication between users, such as when a 3D printer finishes a job, the finished product remains in the machine.  With a note present, a user wishing to use the machine after could know that it's allowable to relocate the finished product.

The third highlight is to use the system to login and check information about attending a local FabLab event. The login step is the same as the one in the second highlight. Users can then press the ‘Event’ button from the main page to get access to information on events.  This will display a list of all the upcoming events at FabLabs the user is tracking (labs the user frequents). In the event page, users can press the ‘ Direction’ button to open an online map of where the event will be taking place. Additionally, users can press the ‘Details’ button to learn more information about each listed event.  The event functionality was added as a social aspect.  In our research we noted that there was a distinct lack of communication between users.  Many Fab Labs host social events or contests, but with the lack of communication between users, we thought this added functionality would support attendance to these events.


## Heuristic Evaluation Results

For the Heuristic Evaluation, we each, individually, stepped through our prototype, searching for potential problems our users may encounter.  We rated these on a scale of 0 (Cosmetic only, no usability problems) to 4 (Major problem, needs immediate fix).  We used Nielsen's Usability Heuristics to judge our design.  They are as follows: "Visibility of system status", "Match between system and the real world", "User Control and Freedom", "Consistency and standards", "Error Prevention", "Recognition rather than recall", "Flexibility and efficieny of use", "Aesthetic and minimalist design", "Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors", and "Help and documentation". 

Once completed, we consolidated our results, removing duplicates and agreeing on severity ratings.  The major problems we identified included: the lack of a preventative measure if one user locks the device while another has it scheduled (overlapping time period), an ambiguous "Lock" button for new users, no logout button for users,  poor navigation from the support page back to the previous page, no quick access functionality for frequent users, and an ambiguous repair icon that may confuse users.  Based on these results, and their severity ratings, we hope to remedy these problems in the next iteration.

Below we list the major problems we encountered, in order of severity.  This choice was made to allow for ease of focus on which problems to address first in the next iteration.  We feel that the bigger problems should be repaired first, and cosmetic problems or minor bugs could be fixed later.

The following lists the major problems(ranked 2 or higher) we encountered, along with a description, a suggested fix, and the severity rating we assigned.

Problem: Currently, no prevention of one user locking the device if another has it scheduled for an overlapping period of time.

Heuristic Violated: Error Prevention

Suggested Fix: Add a popup error message stating the conflict, perhaps with a contact user option to discuss scheduling conflicts.

Severity Rating: 4

Problem: The "Lock" button is a bit ambiguous to a first time user as to it's actual function.

Heuristic Violated: Help and Documentation

Suggested Fix: Add a popup help text, or instructions for how to properly use the lock function in tandem with the scheduling.

Severity Rating: 3

Problem: There currently is no "logout" button for users.

Heuristic Violated: User control and freedom

Suggested Fix: Add a logout button at the right of the login button and only display it if a user is logged in.

Severity Rating: 3

Problem: The "Support" pages' "Back" button only navigates back to the main page, not to the "Device Details" page from which it may have been pressed.

Heuristic Violated: User Control and Freedom

Suggested Fix: Allow the system to keep track of where the user navigates from, and link the "Back" button to that page.

Severity Rating: 3

Problem: Currently, there is no functionality of allow frequent users faster access.

Heuristic Violated: Flexibility and efficiency of use

Suggested Fix: Make logging in go directly to that user's Favorites page, or the most frequently used sub directory.

Severity rating: 2

Problem: The repair icon is ambiguous and doesn't directly lead a user to what they should do next.

Heuristic Violated: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors.

Suggested Fix: If a device is in need of or under repair, scheduling and locking should be blocked.  Additionally, support should auto open or be more apparent as the only option.

Severity Rating: 2
