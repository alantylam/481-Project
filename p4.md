# P4: Final Report and Presentation

## Executive Summary

For this project we decided to create an application for a Fabrication Laboratory (Fab Lab) to potentially solve some problem they may have.  The devices within Fab Labs (Maker Spaces) are often only usable by one person at a time, and often for long periods of time.  We conducted research, coming to the conclusion that the lack of scheduling is the biggest problem any given lab has.  We set forth brainstorming and creating paper prototypes to hone in on a design we thought could solve that major problem, and perhaps add some extra functionality as well.  We then made a verticle prototype of the interface, which includes scheduling features for any machine in a registered lab, as well as the ability to lock a machine for immediate use in order to notify other users of machine usage without those users needing to be present in the lab. We conducted heuristic evaluations on our prototype, and found mainly that for the next iteration we really need to create a system that prevents users from overlapping bookings of a device, as well as some other usability fixes to make the system run more efficiently for new and veteran users.  We believe after that, this interface will be a warranted inclusion in any Fab Lab, increasing productivity and decreasing conflicts between users.

## Introduction

A Fab Lab(or Maker Space) is a place where people, such as students or designers on an industry team, go to bring their ideas to life.  They use machinery such as 3D Printers and Sewing Machines, as well as computers.  Our team set out to not only learn about Fab Labs, but also to discover problems with which we could design something to improve things for not only the local labs, but any Fab Lab in use.  We decided on this project as none of us initially knew anything about what a Fab Lab was, and we thought this allowed for a good example of learning about something new.  This also allowed for us to try to create something "for the users" as we were not personally invested in the project.

## Design Problem

Initially, we wanted to create an application for Fab Labs to help users in some way.  We initially had ideas of an app that allowed for organization, or better inter-lab communication.  After conducting some user research and learning more about Fab Labs, we concluded that our design problem was to create something that helps with the apparent need of a scheduling system, to allow users to be more productive and efficient.

## User Research and Findings

We conducted three types of user research.  Initially we conducted an interview with a frequent Fab Lab user.  During this time, one of our team members observed what other users were doing in the lab.  Lastly we conducted secondary research to get a broader sense of Fab Lab usage.  We found that the biggest complaint from our users was driving to the lab from home, sometimes a 30 minute trip, only to find that the 3D printer was in the middle of a 6-8 hour job.  Users felt like they wasted a lot of time in this situation.  We decided then that creating a solution to this problem was the best focus of our project.  From the secondary research we determined an event function may also be useful, as Fab Labs often host user events.
