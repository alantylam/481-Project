# P4: Final Report and Presentation

## Executive Summary

For this project we decided to create an application for a Fabrication Laboratory (Fab Lab) to potentially solve some problem they may have.  The devices within Fab Labs (Maker Spaces) are often only usable by one person at a time, and often for long periods of time.  We conducted research, coming to the conclusion that the lack of scheduling is the biggest problem any given lab has.  We set forth brainstorming and creating paper prototypes to hone in on a design we thought could solve that major problem, and perhaps add some extra functionality as well.  We then made a verticle prototype of the interface, which includes scheduling features for any machine in a registered lab, as well as the ability to lock a machine for immediate use in order to notify other users of machine usage without those users needing to be present in the lab. We conducted heuristic evaluations on our prototype, and found mainly that for the next iteration we really need to create a system that prevents users from overlapping bookings of a device, as well as some other usability fixes to make the system run more efficiently for new and veteran users.  We believe after that, this interface will be a warranted inclusion in any Fab Lab, increasing productivity and decreasing conflicts between users.

## Introduction

A Fab Lab(or Maker Space) is a place where people, such as students or designers on an industry team, go to bring their ideas to life.  They use machinery such as 3D Printers and Sewing Machines, as well as computers.  Our team set out to not only learn about Fab Labs, but also to discover problems with which we could design something to improve things for not only the local labs, but any Fab Lab in use.  We decided on this project as none of us initially knew anything about what a Fab Lab was, and we thought this allowed for a good example of learning about something new.  This also allowed for us to try to create something "for the users" as we were not personally invested in the project.

## Design Problem

Initially, we wanted to create a mobile application for Fab Labs to help users in some way.  We initially had ideas of an app that allowed for organization, or better inter-lab communication.  After conducting some user research and learning more about Fab Labs, we concluded that our design problem was to create something that helps with the apparent need of a scheduling system, to allow users to be more productive and efficient.

## User Research and Findings

We conducted three types of user research.  Initially we conducted an interview with a frequent Fab Lab user.  During this time, one of our team members observed what other users were doing in the lab.  Lastly we conducted secondary research to get a broader sense of Fab Lab usage.  We found that the biggest complaint from our users was driving to the lab from home, sometimes a 30 minute trip, only to find that the 3D printer was in the middle of a 6-8 hour job.  Users felt like they wasted a lot of time in this situation.  We decided then that creating a solution to this problem was the best focus of our project.  From the secondary research we determined an event function may also be useful, as Fab Labs often host user events.

## Design and Justification

To come up with a design, we brainstormed and created an affinity diagram, we created a storyboard, and we did some paper prototyping. We then created a task centered system walkthrough once we decided on a design to focus on. From this we created a video prototype to determine if our design sufficiently solved the problem we set out to fix.  Though we came up with some drastically different ideas, for current implementation, we decided to stick to a more current model for our design.  We determined the interface's main focus should be the scheduling of machine usage, as everything else was secondary to our design problem. Though we could have created a design not currently feasible, we decided using this design would allow for a more immediate adoption of use.  Users could easily watch our video prototype and determine if the app is something they would want to use in a Fab Lab.  
 
 From here, we created a verticle prototype using Axure.  We finalized the design with a focus on listing the devices in a frequented lab, with "Favorites" functionality.  Once a device was picked, the user could schedule it for future use, or lock it for immediate use.  This implementation allowed for other users to monitor the status of devices remotely, and thus be aware that a device they use was being used by someone else.  We added an "Events" section for information about upcoming events related to the Fab Lab chosen. This was due to our findings in the secondary research, and wanting to allow users to have an "all in the palm of your hand" experience.  We also touched on Support functionality for if a device was damaged or broken, to help organize things for the Fab Lab manager.  Lastly we considered a chat functionality to further the notition of better communication and usage awareness within the lab.  

## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings

We individually conducted Heuristic Evaluations on our finalized design. These were done with a focus on usability issues new and veteran users alike may have when using the system.  We found that the biggest problem was the lack of prevention of two different users trying to schedule or lock a machine at the same time. We also found that the "Lock" button in our interface might be a bit ambiguous to first time users. It was noted that there was no logout feature for users who logged in.  We also noticed that the "Back" button only navigated back to the main page, and not to the page the user was originally on.  We found some other issues that were not as major as these, and as such put them to the side to be addressed once these issues were worked out.

## Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design

For our next iteration, we definitely wish to fix the problems our heuristic evaluations uncovered.  Specifically we would implement in the scheduling functionality to prevent users having overlapped bookings, as well as a function to allow users to connect to others with whom there may be a time conflict in order to communicate better. We might change the name of the "Lock" button, or add some help text to make it's function less ambiguous. We want to add a logout feature as well.  We would also have the "Back" button update with the previous page navigated from.  We think fixing this usability issues would greatly improve the design for all users.  We also feel that these fixes should be relatively easy to implement, now that we have a working prototype to build on.  Depending on time and funding restraints, we can also look into fixing the minor issues we identified in our heuristic evaluations, as well as fully implementing the chat functionality.

## Conclusions

Throughout this project, we had the idea in mind of creating a useful application for Fab Lab users.  We wanted to make something that would be used daily and encourage users to use the labs more.  We hope that our app design can detract from the negative experiences user have with a Fab Lab and in turn promote more frequent lab usage.  With the focus on this application being a mobile app, we think users would be happy to be able to check the schedules and usage of the devices they are interested in from anywhere.  Since Fab Labs are about making ideas reality, users should only have to focus on designing and creating things, not stressing over if the Lab's "Formlab Form 2" 3D printer is being used all day by someone else.  We hope to be able to continue with this project, as we learned alot of different things, and we think this app will help people.
