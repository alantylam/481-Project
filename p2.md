# P2: Ideation and Lo-fi Prototypes

## Video Prototype
(Include video file here)
[](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMINSD7MmT4)

In this video we describe a walkthrough description of the basic functionality of our App.  We begin with opening the app, going directly to the devices interface (Machines), then looking at a device/machine file.  On this screen one can see the details of any device, can see the status of that device (Free, in use, in need of repair), if the device is set to a favorite, book (schedule) the device, lock the device for immediate use, or contact support for the device.  Booking the device brings up a basic calendar functionality that shows all planned usage for the device.  Choosing a free time slot, after confirmation, books that date/time with your information as using the machine.  Back on the details page, if you have the device scheduled in the future, an "!" appears beside the book option, alerting the user that they already have a booked appointment.   Next the lock option is used to immediately lock the device for use (IE the user is in the lab and wants to use the device right away, as it is free).  In the video this changes the status icon from green (free) to yellow (in use).  We're considering added functionality of collecting expected work/job time input, to better avoid conflicts both with the scheduler and the locking feature, as was brought up in discussion.

## Task-Centered System Walkthrough

Below we walk through the system's usage following the task of scheduling a machine for later use and locking the machine for use once the user arrives in the lab.  Through this exercise we noted various changes we may want to implement to further hone our design.  We noted that we may want add some extra details or help functionality for first time users for setting up the lab they intend to use.  We also noticed that for the goal of booking, the users may click on "Events" instead, thinking that would lead to the schedule.  We concurred that, once logged in, changing "Book" to "Schedule" or something similar would alleviate confusion about simply viewing the upcoming schedule. Alternatively we could add an extra schedule button to simply view the schedule, and keep the "Book" button as is.  We agreed that estimated task/job time is needed for better scheduling functionality.  We noted at the end that unlocking a device, while ideally not necessary, might not be obvious, as with machines like the 3D Printer, once a job is finished the user needs to collect the created object.  So technically the machine would stay in use until the whole job was completed.  In this case we cannot rely on the device status changing (theoretically), so the user would have to notify the app that the machine is once again unlocked.

## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram

(Need to create an affinity diagram, the needed functionality of our app, optional, categories these things would fall under.

## Reflection

Overall, this portion of hte project helped to better hone our ideas of what to do with the app.  We identified the need for added functionality, such as job time, as well as create a better understanding of what we want to presetn the users with.  The storyboard and video prototyping portions were fun and really helped us to wrap our heads around what we are doing.  If we were to do something different next time/again, it would be more devotion to the sketching phase.  We did have some unique and interesting ideas (like the keyfob, or the VR/AR space), but we didn't expand on many of these ideas further just to see where they would take us if nothing else.
(Insert comments about finished task centered walkthrough).
