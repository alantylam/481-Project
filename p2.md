# P2: Ideation and Lo-fi Prototypes

## Video Prototype
https://youtu.be/nWG25PJW7Z8

In this video we describe a walkthrough description of the basic functionality of our App.  We begin with opening the app, going directly to the devices interface (Machines), then looking at a device/machine file.  On this screen one can see the details of any device, can see the status of that device (Free, in use, in need of repair), if the device is set to a favorite, book (schedule) the device, lock the device for immediate use, or contact support for the device.  Booking the device brings up a basic calendar functionality that shows all planned usage for the device.  Choosing a free time slot, after confirmation, books that date/time with your information as using the machine.  Back on the details page, if you have the device scheduled in the future, an "!" appears beside the book option, alerting the user that they already have a booked appointment.   Next the lock option is used to immediately lock the device for use (IE the user is in the lab and wants to use the device right away, as it is free).  In the video this changes the status icon from green (free) to yellow (in use).  We're considering added functionality of collecting expected work/job time input, to better avoid conflicts both with the scheduler and the locking feature, as was brought up in discussion.

## Storyboard

The storyboard illustrates a user going to and entering a Fab Lab.  Once there, they use their phone to open the FabLab App, add a new device by syncing with a device in the lab, then selecting the device.  Once selected, they view the status and details of the machine, and decide to book the device for later use.  This brings up a calendar/scheduling page.  The user schedules the device for use at 9AM on May/XX, then is returned to the details page where an "!" appears next to Book, alerting the user that s/he has a scheduled usage.  The user finally decides to lock the device for use right now and, pressing the lock button, can see that the status has changed.

## Task-Centered System Walkthrough

Below we walk through the system's usage following the task of scheduling a machine for later use and locking the machine for use once the user arrives in the lab.  Through this exercise we noted various changes we may want to implement to further hone our design.  We noted that we may want add some extra details or help functionality for first time users for setting up the lab they intend to use.  We also noticed that for the goal of booking, the users may click on "Events" instead, thinking that would lead to the schedule.  We concurred that, once logged in, changing "Book" to "Schedule" or something similar would alleviate confusion about simply viewing the upcoming schedule. Alternatively we could add an extra schedule button to simply view the schedule, and keep the "Book" button as is.  We agreed that estimated task/job time is needed for better scheduling functionality.  We noted at the end that unlocking a device, while ideally not necessary, might not be obvious, as with machines like the 3D Printer, once a job is finished the user needs to collect the created object.  So technically the machine would stay in use until the whole job was completed.  In this case we cannot rely on the device status changing (theoretically), so the user would have to notify the app that the machine is once again unlocked.

## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram
![](https://alantylam.github.io/481-Project/Photo/Diagram.jpg)

In the brainstorm process, we considered building a lab machine booking application. As a booking application, we got an idea to use a login function for registered lab users to login. There should be a calendar built into the app. A book function would be needed and should be linked to certain machine calendars. It would show booked times and add new booking times to calendars when users tried to book machines. Next, we found that we would need a page for each lab machine. It should have descriptions for certain lab machines and has a picture of that machine. One idea on this page is to create a favorite star selection. Once it is selected, that machine will become a user’s favorite machine and the user can get notifications from the app about that machine anytime. Another idea was a signal light showing the current status of that machine. If the light is yellow, it means the machine is in use. If the light is red, it means the machine is in need of repairing. If the light is green, then it means the machine is available. This signal light would have auto connectivity to each machine. Also, there would be a support button on this page in case users need technical support. What’s more, we found that sometimes users might not go to the lab even when they have a machine booked because of some emergency. So we are thinking about a lock function on the machine page. It will lock such that you can only find it enabled when you are close to the lab or in the lab. It will change the signal light from green to yellow once the user presses it. In the end, we had an idea of a home page (view list). It would be a list of the names of all lab machines and a signal light on the right. There could also be view buttons to get into certain lab machine pages.

Above are some of the images in our brainstorming process.  The top two show some of the broader ideas we began with, such as a keyfob that detected and alerted similar to a pager when a synced machine was in use, or a VR space/360 Camera controller lab.  The idea for the VR space/360 Camera lab was to have the lab mimiced either through video or a VR space, and in doing so allowing users remote live access to the machines they desired to use.  Technically limitations definitely applied to this idea.  The final three closeup images are rough models of page ideas we decided to use.

## Reflection

Overall, this portion of the project helped to better hone our ideas of what to do with the app.  We identified the need for added functionality, such as job time, as well as create a better understanding of what we want to present the users with.  The storyboard and video prototyping portions were fun and really helped us to wrap our heads around what we are doing.  If we were to do something different next time/again, it would be more devotion to the sketching phase.  We did have some unique and interesting ideas (like the keyfob, or the VR/AR space), but we didn't expand on many of these ideas further due to time and technical limitations. The Task Centered System Walkthrough helped us to identify some potential problems, like confusion with the "Book" functionality.  

For us, the storyboarding and video prototyping worked best for allowing us to visualize the app. As mentioned above, the sketching phase felt a little lacking.  Though initally less interested in the Task Centered System Walkthrough, thinking of it as a perhaps a chore, we realized the value such a walkthrough holds when we saw the potential problems come up, even from a potential experienced user.
