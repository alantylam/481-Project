## Project Idea

![](https://alantylam.github.io/481-Project/Photo/IMG_0814.JPG)

Our project consists of creating an app to help users of Fabrication Laboratories (Fab Labs) with time management problems involving equipment scheduling. This idea was inspired by a Fab Lab user in Calgary who delayed his own project due to the lack of a scheduling system. To increase the efficiency of Fab Labs, our app will offer features which include, but are not limited to, helping the users check the availability of different equipment, scheduling usage of equipment and providing a list of ongoing projects in Fab Labs. The main targets are current Fab Lab users and people who will potentially develop their projects in a Fab Lab. We expect users to take advantage of the equipment scheduling function in our app to reduce productivity and time management problems. This app will be helpful at Fab Lab locations with high traffic and to connect potential developers with other Fab Lab users. Our app will effectively improve usersâ€™ time management by organizing the usage of machinery even with a limited availability from the Fab Lab.

Above are some rough sketches for ideas of the app.  The first is a series of sketches displaying our ideas for machine tracking and booking on the app, as well as a basic keyfob idea.  The second image is a rough idea of a VR space that mimics the FabLab space, affording users remote access to the machines through the VR space.
