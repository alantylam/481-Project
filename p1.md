# P1: User Research

*final editing (Jared)

## Project Idea (Alan)

Our project consists of creating an app to help users of Fabrication Laboratories (Fab Labs) with time management problems involving equipment scheduling. This idea was inspired by a Fab Lab user in Calgary who delayed his own project due to the lack of a scheduling system. To increase the efficiency of Fab Labs, our app will offer features which include, but are not limited to, helping the users check the availability of different equipment, scheduling usage of equipment and providing a list of ongoing projects in Fab Labs. The main targets are current Fab Lab users and people who will potentially develop their projects in a Fab Lab. We expect users to take advantage of the equipment scheduling function in our app to reduce productivity and time management problems. This app will be helpful at Fab Lab locations with high traffic and to connect potential developers with other Fab Lab users. Our app will effectively improve users’ time management by organizing the usage of machinery even with a limited availability from the Fab Lab.


## Stakeholders and Users (Jared)

Lab Owner/Supervisor:

Generally a high knowledge of the system and previous experience dealing with a FabLab and/or scheduling details.  The system could be used by the lab owner/supervisor to maintain a sense of order to their lab, ensuring that there are fewer conflicts and easier resolution of conflicts regarding the need of specific machines or workstations.  This would potentially allow for an increase in desire to use the space, as the stigma of not being able to use the machine you need when you go to the space would be removed.

Students: 

Undergraduate students would be expected to have limited to no knowledge of a FabLab or the proposed system, and little to no experience. Graduate students we expect to have a working knowledge of both, as well as at least some experience.
The design of the system incorporates the users as those that use the various machinery in the FabLab. The potential for scheduling also allows for users to better conserve their time, as well as to meet with other users to discuss or learn about their projects.

Faculty:

The faculty would use the system in much the same way as students, with the added notion of supervising needs. Their knowledge and experience would be expected to be higher than students, but not necessarily as high as the Owner/Supervisor.  The faculty could use it themselves, if they’re performing their own independent research project.  Alternatively, they could use the app to both schedule and oversee their students working on their projects, or reserve a specific machine or workstation for use in their projects.


## User Research Methods (Jay)

For our project, we have used three user research methods. 

The first method is Interview. Since none of us has been to a fab lab yet,  the best way to know about fab labs is to interview a person who has experience with them. We sought both general information as well as details on potential problems with the lab usage. 

The second method is Observation. We observed the fab lab on the 6th floor of the Math Science building, watched graduate students doing experiments in it, and took several photos about the lab. This method is useful to see what people actually do in fab labs, rather than just get information from what they said.

The third method is secondary research. We searched published articles, papers and online resources to help us on developing the design ideas. It is a useful and efficient way to ground our observation and to develop a point of view on our design.


### User Research Method 1: Interview (Jared)

Summary of findings:

Through the course of the interview we found that much of the social aspect happened organically, so our original notions of how scheduling might be used changed. Users often will see another user working on something and casually approach to learn and discuss the project, out of curiosity if nothing else.  We also discovered that, unless there is either a nondisclosure agreement in place or some competition for ideas at stake, information is mostly freely shared among users. 

Probably the biggest “bottleneck” in terms of efficient use of the space was found to be the limited number of machines, specifically the 3D printers.  Due to the limit on these machines, we found that users had some anxiety about using the lab all the time because they had no way of knowing if the machine they needed was available or not.  Specifically with the 3D printers, one task could sometimes take up to 12 hours.  On top of that, sometimes finished tasks are left in the printer, and it was unknown whether or not it was safe to move those projects without damaging them.  

Our subject thought that an app that both allowed for scheduling and remote access to see if a particular machine was available would be useful. However for scheduling everyone using the lab would need to be using the scheduler or else it would not help.

From this we determined our app should focus on the machine monitoring/scheduling, with person to person interaction being secondary.

### User Research Method 2: Observation (Jay) (add links to the notes you took that you shared on slack)

![](https://github.com/alantylam/481-Project/blob/master/Photo/IMG_0816.JPG)
Summary of findings:

Through the observation of the fab lab in the math science building, we found that this place is more research focused. It has all the needed equipment, but the space is a little bit small. The average number of people using the lab is from 0 to 3, and their continuous work time is up to 6 hours. In the pictures we took, there are only two 3D printers and few other machines in the lab. There are enough machines if there is just one person working on his task. However, if there are more than 3 people working at the same time, the machines might not be available for all of them and the room will probably be crowded. 

We also asked the graduate students using the lab while doing the observation and found that they usually do not know who else is using the lab. But they would like to know when people are using it, when the machines are available, running, or finished.

Therefore, our design idea is to build the schedule of the lab into an application. This application should be easy for user to book machines and check the status of different machines.

### User Research Method 3: Secondary Research (Alan)
(add link to ProtoSpace, and Startup Calgary)
Summary of findings:

Through secondary research, we found no application that shows information about Fab Labs in Calgary nor much information from a very limited number of websites that are from Calgary. Since there is not much information about Fab Labs in Calgary, we expect our app to be a big help in terms of boosting the efficiency for current and future artists, creators and technologists.

From the few websites that we researched on, we discovered that two of them hosted events that allows potential Fab Lab users to connect with other who are already working on existing projects. The first one, ProtoSpace, is a Calgary based Fab Lab that hosts weekly ‘Meet & Geeks’ with the goal of bonding new and senior creators to refine their project ideas.  The interesting thing about this Fab Lab is the membership fee of over 600$ for 24/7 access, which largely restricts the free usage of the facility.  The second one, Startup Calgary, is not a Fab Lab but an organization where they advocate and connect future Fab Lab users with the start-up community. However, neither have a scheduling function which Fab Lab users could use to better coordinate their time.

As the result of this research method, I believe it will be useful for us to include an event function to our app, not only will it help Fab Lab users to showcase their projects in events, but also allow for the possibility to turn their ideas into reality.

### Reflections on User Research (Jay)
(Listing of the facts gleaned from above)

According to our user research, fabrication labs are sometimes used as a place for courses, but they are mainly for research purposes. The individual work time can be up to 6 hours. Through our interview, observation, and secondary research, we found that the number of machines in a lab are limited. Therefore, it is inconvenient for users to use the machines at any time they want. They usually do not know the status of the machine they want to use unless they go to the lab to check by themselves. For example, if one of the users took 30 minutes to come to the lab trying to do research and found that all the machines were occupied, he/she would waste a lot of time. In addition, if the 3D Printers they need have been used by someone, they have to  ask that person to collect their project or get permission to move the completed object. Since it is quite inconvenient for users, they would like to know the status of machines and when people use it.


## Task Descriptions (Alan)
(6-8 Task examples)
1. Peter Thompson is a 45 year old man.  He has been the fab lab supervisor at University of Calgary for 5 years.  He's been working hard the last few weeks, and it was just brought to his attention by a new user of the lab that one of the 3D printers is broken. Peter wants to get angry, as he thought the students were responsible enough to report something like this when it occurred.  He now needs to examine the machine himself to ensure it is broken, find out who last used the machine to determine if someone broke it by incorrect usage, or if it just broke down, and schedule maintenance on the machine.

2. Mary Linsgard is 35 years old.  She is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at University of Calgary.  Mary just assigned a group of undergradute students a project on prototyping a submersible drone.  She wishes for them to use the campus Fab Lab in order to come up with ideas and prototype the drone with the 3D printer, so she will be taking them to the lab this afternoon at 3pm to both allow them inside as well as to get them started using the 3D printer and the associated software.  

3. Tommy Chan is a third-year CPSC student from University of Calgary. Tommy likes the idea of turning imaginations into reality. Since he never had any experience in this aspect, he decides to go to a Fab Lab located in University of Calgary’s Math Science Building, and observe what projects are currently being develop in the Fab Lab. Through his observation he was interested in one of the project, and he wants to inquire about joining the team for their development.

4. Michelle Lynn is a second-year student who is interested in developing her ideas into reality. However, she cannot seem to find people who share the same interest. From one of her classes, she got in touch with the term “FabLab”. So, she decided to go to University of Calgary’s Garage 142 to see if she can get a better understanding of what exactly is a FabLab. After she come to understand the purpose of Fab Lab, she visited one of the Fab Lab and see if anyone will be interested in making her idea come true.

5. Hazel Wearmouth, is a 30 year old who is passionate about technology. She has spent the past 4 months trying to develop her idea of a sonic bubble into a visual prototype. She now has a visualized prototype thanks to the resources from University’s Fab Lab. However, she is having trouble finding a way to connect with other people, people who might be interested in putting investment into her project, so she can begin the production of her prototype, and launch it to the market. 

6. Laurie Anderson, who is currently developing a prototype flying light fixture with her team from University of Calgary. She lives in the far east side of the city. Her prototype requires a fair amount of work with the 3D printing machine from the Fab Lab. She often arrives at the lab to find that the machine is already occupied by other people.  She hates to waste a trip to the university when she is never sure if the 3D printer will be available or not.
